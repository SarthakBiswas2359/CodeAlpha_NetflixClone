1. I have manually entered my login credentials to demonstrate the dynamic nature of the website so to use the login function properly create a database and then create a table in it with 2 fields: email,password. 
2. After creating the table just edit the signin.php file and add your password and database name to it. Also dont forget to change the table name in the same code.
3. I have used different fonts , they're available in the repo with the .ttf extension
4. If the video file doesn't work or if you are unable to download the video ("referring to 'JW-DOMINION.mp4' as video),then pleased download some other video and add that to the same folder and then update the path in the hompage.html file.
